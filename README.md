# Online Sports Retail Company Analysis
 Sports clothing and athleisure attire is a huge industry, worth approximately $193 billion in 2021 with a strong growth forecast over the next decade! This repository contains a report and dataset of an online sports retail company, including tables for information, finance, reviews, traffic, and brands. I dived into product data such as pricing, reviews, descriptions, and ratings, as well as revenue and website traffic, to produce recommendations for its marketing and sales teams. The dataset is also available in CSV format and can be easily imported into SQL, R or Python.
